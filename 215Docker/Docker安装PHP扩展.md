# Install PHP extensions on Docker

Iâ€™m developing PHP applications on Docker containers. But there are some points you will struggle to solve even though you use official Docker images. For this time, I will introduce how we can install extensions for PHP on Docker.

### Core extensions

According to [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/), some `docker-php-ext-*` commands are prepared for users to install extensions easily on the containers. For example, you add the following line to Dockerfile to install `curl` extension.

```
RUN docker-php-ext-install curl
```

### Pecl extensions

Pecl extensions will be also easy to be put on the containers. If you want to install `memcached` extension, you can do that like below.

```
RUN pecl install memcached \
    && docker-php-ext-enable memcached
```

Above all, it looks like very easy steps to deal with that. But you will be in trouble when you try to install extensions which need PHP compiling options.

### Pecl extensions with Compiling options

Actually, I consumed a long time to solve this problem when I install `mailparse` extension which requires `--enable-mailparse` option to build PHP.

Finally, I got the solution. In Dockerfile of offical image, I found `$PHP_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS` .

https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/9abc1efe542b56aa93835e4987d5d4a88171b232/7.0/alpine/Dockerfile#L121

From Docker version 1.9, `--build-arg` option is provided to define environmental variables when we build Dockerfile. So you can add compiling options like this.

```
docker build . \
    --build-arg PHP_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-mailparse"
```

Then you put pecl installation on Dockerfile.

```
RUN pecl install mailparse \
    && docker-php-ext-enable mailparse
```
